Introduction

This machine learning project aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the K-means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation can help businesses understand different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering similar data points together.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains customer purchase history data. The data should have columns representing different products or product categories and corresponding purchase amounts by each customer. The dataset should be in a suitable CSV format.

The structure of the dataset could be as follows:

CustomerID	ProductA	ProductB	ProductC   ...	ProductN

    1	      20.0	      10.0	      5.0	   ...	  8.0
    2	      15.0	      12.0	      3.0	   ...	  10.0
    3	      18.0	      8.0	      4.0	   ...	  12.0
    ...	      ...	      ...	      ...	   ...	  ...

Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn.
Usage
Prepare your dataset: Ensure that you have a CSV file with columns representing different products and corresponding purchase amounts by each customer. Replace 'customer_data.csv' in the code with your dataset file name.

Perform customer segmentation: Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository and run the code to perform customer segmentation using K-means clustering.

Results

After running the code, you will obtain the cluster labels for each customer, indicating which segment they belong to. You can analyze the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into different customer groups.

With this README, users will have a clear understanding of the project's purpose, dataset, installation steps, usage instructions, and how to contribute to the project. The code snippet provides an example of how to use the K-means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation based on purchase history. Replace 'customer_data.csv' with your actual dataset file name to perform customer segmentation with your own data.

Remember that customer segmentation using K-means clustering is just one way to understand customer groups. Depending on the nature of the data and the business objectives, you may need to explore other clustering algorithms or employ additional data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
